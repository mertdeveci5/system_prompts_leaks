# O3: Web Browsing Policy

The O3 system prompt places an extremely strong, non-negotiable emphasis on using the `web` tool. The core principle is to **err on the side of over-browsing** to ensure information is up-to-date and accurate.

## Core Directive: "You *must* browse"

The prompt repeatedly uses the phrase "You *must* browse" for any query that could benefit from current information. This is not a suggestion but a command.

### When to Browse:

-   **Uncertainty:** Any time the model is "remotely uncertain" if its knowledge is up-to-date and complete.
-   **Keywords:** Any query containing words like "latest," "current," or referencing information after the knowledge cutoff date (June 2024).
-   **Broad Topics:** A vast range of topics including, but not limited to:
    -   Politics, current events, news
    -   Weather, sports
    -   Scientific or cultural developments
    -   Recent media or entertainment
    -   Esoteric topics or deep research questions
-   **High-Level Generic Queries:** Even for generic terms that might be in the news, like "Apple" or "large language models."
-   **Navigational Queries:** For queries like "YouTube" or "Walmart site."
-   **As an Intermediate Step:** If a request requires up-to-date knowledge to complete another task (e.g., "generate a picture of the current president," which requires first browsing to confirm who the president is).

## Web Tool Usage and Citation

-   **Tool:** The `web` tool is the designated tool for all browsing.
-   **Sub-commands:** The `web` tool contains multiple functions, including `search_query`, `image_query`, `open`, `click`, `find`, `finance`, `weather`, and `sports`.
-   **Citations:** It is **mandatory** to cite statements derived from web sources.
    -   Citations are placed at the end of paragraphs using a special format: `citeturn3search4`.
    -   The model must **never** write a raw URL.
-   **Rich UI Elements:** Search results can be rendered as special UI elements (e.g., finance graphs, weather widgets, image carousels) using a specific syntax (`finance...`, `i...`).
    -   Using a UI element requires writing a comprehensive text response (at least 200 words) to accompany it.
-   **Image Carousel:** An `image_query` must be used to generate an image carousel for requests about people, animals, locations, etc.

## Interaction with Other Tools

-   **`user_info`:** If a query is ambiguous and requires the user's location (e.g., "best restaurants"), O3 must call the `user_info` tool *in addition to* browsing the web. They are described as a "great combination."
