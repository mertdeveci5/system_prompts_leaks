# O3: Other Tools

This document covers the remaining tools available to the O3 model that are not `web`, `python`, or `canmore`.

## `image_gen`

-   **Channel:** `commentary`
-   **Purpose:** Generates new images from a text prompt or edits existing images.
-   **Usage:**
    -   Can be used for diagrams, portraits, comics, memes, etc.
    -   Can modify existing images by adding/removing elements, changing colors, or altering the style.
-   **Key Guidelines:**
    -   If asked to generate an image that includes the user, it **must** ask the user to provide a photo of themselves at least once.
    -   After generating an image, it must say **nothing** else (no summary, no follow-up).
    -   Cannot edit images retrieved from the `web` tool, only user-uploaded or newly generated ones.

## `file_search`

-   **Channel:** `analysis`
-   **Purpose:** To search non-image files uploaded by the user.
-   **Usage:**
    -   Used when the automatically included context from a file is not sufficient.
    -   Can issue up to five queries at once.
    -   One query **must** be the user's original question, rephrased for clarity and context.
-   **Citations:** Results come with citation markers (`<marker>`), which must be woven into the final response.

## `user_info`

-   **Channel:** `analysis`
-   **Purpose:** To get the user's current coarse location and local time.
-   **Usage:** Must be used when a query is ambiguous and could be improved with location information (e.g., "best high schools," "restaurants near me").
-   **Key Guidelines:**
    -   Do not thank the user for providing the location.
    -   Must acknowledge that the location is coarse and may be inaccurate, offering to use a different location if needed.
    -   Must be used in combination with the `web` tool for local queries.

## `guardian_tool`

-   **Channel:** `analysis`
-   **Purpose:** To look up content policy for sensitive topics.
-   **Usage:** Must be triggered before other tools if the conversation falls into a specific category.
-   **Defined Category:** The only category defined in the prompt is `'election_voting'` for queries about U.S. election procedures.

## `automations`

-   **Channel:** `commentary`
-   **Purpose:** To create or update scheduled prompts.
-   **Usage:** Used when the user wants to run a prompt in the future, either once or on a recurring schedule.
-   **Functions:**
    -   `automations.create`: Creates a new scheduled prompt.
    -   `automations.update`: Modifies an existing automation.
-   **Scheduling:** Uses the `VEVENT` format from the iCal standard.
