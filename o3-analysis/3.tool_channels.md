# O3: The Channel System

The O3 prompt introduces a rigid "channel" system to structure its reasoning and responses. Every message from the model **must** be assigned to one of three valid channels: `analysis`, `commentary`, or `final`.

This system separates the model's internal "thought process" from the tools that generate user-visible content and the final, polished answer.

## 1. The `analysis` Channel

-   **Purpose:** For private reasoning and internal analysis tool calls.
-   **Visibility:** Content in this channel is **never** shown directly to the user.
-   **Allowed Tools:**
    -   `python` (the private version)
    -   `web`
    -   `user_info`
    -   `guardian_tool`
    -   `file_search`

## 2. The `commentary` Channel

-   **Purpose:** For user-visible tool calls only. This is how O3 generates rich content like plots, tables, and interactive documents.
-   **Visibility:** The *output* of these tools is shown to the user.
-   **Content Rule:** This channel is **only** for tool calls. No plain-text messages or reasoning are allowed.
-   **Allowed Tools:**
    -   `python_user_visible`
    -   `canmore` (and its functions `create_textdoc`, `update_textdoc`, `comment_textdoc`)
    -   `automations`
    -   `image_gen`
    -   `bio` (Note: `bio` is mentioned here but not defined elsewhere in the provided prompt)

## 3. The `final` Channel

-   **Purpose:** For the assistant's final, user-facing reply.
-   **Content Rule:** This channel should contain only the polished, conversational response. It must not contain any tool calls or private chain-of-thought.
-   **Visibility:** This is the text the user reads as the model's direct answer.
