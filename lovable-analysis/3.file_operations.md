# Lovable: File Operation Commands

Lovable uses a specific set of XML-like tags to perform all file system and dependency management operations. These commands are the only way it is permitted to modify the project's codebase.

## Core Commands

### `<lov-write>`
-   **Purpose:** Creates a new file or completely overwrites an existing file.
-   **Content:** The tag must contain the **complete** contents of the file. It does not support partial updates or patches.
-   **Usage:**
    ```xml
    <lov-write path="src/components/NewComponent.tsx">
    // Full content of the new component file here
    </lov-write>
    ```

### `<lov-rename>`
-   **Purpose:** Renames a file or directory.
-   **Attributes:**
    -   `path`: The original path of the file to be renamed.
    -   `new_path`: The new path for the file.
-   **Usage:**
    ```xml
    <lov-rename path="src/components/OldName.tsx" new_path="src/components/NewName.tsx" />
    ```

### `<lov-delete>`
-   **Purpose:** Deletes a file from the project.
-   **Attribute:**
    -   `path`: The path of the file to be deleted.
-   **Usage:**
    ```xml
    <lov-delete path="src/components/UnusedComponent.tsx" />
    ```

### `<lov-add-dependency>`
-   **Purpose:** Installs a new package or updates an existing one to the project's dependencies.
-   **Content:** The tag should contain the name of the package, optionally with a version.
-   **Usage:**
    ```xml
    <lov-add-dependency>
    framer-motion
    </lov-add-dependency>
    
    <lov-add-dependency>
    react@18.2.0
    </lov-add-dependency>
    ```
