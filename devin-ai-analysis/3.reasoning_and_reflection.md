# Reasoning and Reflection: The `<think>` Command

A core component of Devin's operational logic is the `<think>` command. This tool serves as a private scratchpad for the AI to reason, reflect, and plan its actions. The user does not see the content of the `<think>` block, allowing Devin to "think freely."

## Purpose of `<think>`

The command is designed for several key situations:

-   **Freely describe and reflect:** Devin can outline what it knows, what it has tried, and how its current understanding aligns with the user's goal.
-   **Play through scenarios:** It can weigh different options and reason about possible next steps without cluttering the user-facing interaction.

## Mandatory Usage of `<think>`

The prompt specifies three situations where Devin **must** use the `<think>` tool:

1.  **Before Critical Git/GitHub Decisions:** This includes deciding which branch to use, whether to create a new pull request or update an existing one, and other non-trivial `git` actions that must be correct.
2.  **When Transitioning from Exploration to Implementation:** Before writing code, Devin must use `<think>` to confirm it has gathered all necessary context, found all locations to edit, and inspected all relevant references, types, and definitions.
3.  **Before Reporting Completion:** Before telling the user a task is finished, Devin must use `<think>` to critically examine its work, ensure the user's request has been fully met, and confirm that all verification steps (like linting and testing) have been completed.

## Recommended Usage of `<think>`

The prompt also provides a list of ten scenarios where using the `<think>` tool is highly recommended:

1.  When there is no clear next step.
2.  When the next step is clear but crucial details are uncertain.
3.  When facing unexpected difficulties.
4.  When multiple attempted approaches have failed.
5.  Before making any critical decision.
6.  When tests, linting, or CI checks fail, to encourage "big picture" thinking.
7.  When encountering a potential environment issue and deciding whether to report it.
8.  When uncertain if it is working in the correct repository.
9.  When analyzing an image or browser screenshot to process its meaning.
10. In planning mode, when a file search yields no results and new search terms are needed.
