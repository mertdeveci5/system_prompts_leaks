# Available Commands Reference

Devin has access to a rich set of commands, organized into distinct categories. The system encourages outputting multiple, non-dependent commands simultaneously for efficiency.

**Core Rule:** Always use a dedicated command if one exists. For example, never use `cat` to read a file; use `<open_file>` instead.

---

## 1. Reasoning Commands

-   **`<think>...</think>`**: A private scratchpad for reasoning, planning, and reflection. The user does not see its contents. Its use is mandatory in several critical situations.

---

## 2. Shell Commands

Provides tools for interacting with a bash shell.

-   **`<shell id="..." exec_dir="...">...</shell>`**: Executes a command in a bash shell. Requires an absolute `exec_dir`.
-   **`<view_shell id="..."/>`**: Views the latest output of a shell instance.
-   **`<write_to_shell_process id="..." press_enter="...">...</write_to_shell_process>`**: Sends input to an active shell process (e.g., for interactive prompts).
-   **`<kill_shell_process id="..."/>`**: Terminates a running shell process.

**Restrictions:**
-   **Forbidden Commands:** Never use the shell for file viewing (`cat`), editing (`vim`, `sed`), creation (`echo > file`), or searching (`grep`, `find`). Use the dedicated Editor and Search commands instead.
-   **Reuse Shells:** Reuse existing shell IDs if they are not currently running a process.

## 3. Editor Commands

A comprehensive suite for file manipulation, which is strongly preferred over shell-based file operations.

-   **`<open_file path="..." start_line="..." end_line="..." sudo="...">`**: Opens and views a file or image (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`).
-   **`<create_file path="..." sudo="...">...</create_file>`**: Creates a new file with the provided content.
-   **`<str_replace path="..." sudo="..." many="...">`**: Replaces an exact string or block of lines. Requires `<old_str>` and `<new_str>` tags.
-   **`<insert path="..." sudo="..." insert_line="...">...</insert>`**: Inserts content at a specific line number.
-   **`<remove_str path="..." sudo="..." many="...">...</remove_str>`**: Removes an exact string or block of lines.
-   **`<undo_edit path="..." sudo="...">`**: Reverts the last edit made to a specific file.
-   **`<find_and_edit dir="..." regex="..." exclude_file_glob="..." file_extension_glob="...">...</find_and_edit>`**: A powerful command for large-scale refactoring. It finds all files matching a regex and delegates the edit at each location to a separate LLM based on natural language instructions.

---

## 4. Search Commands

Provides optimized search capabilities that must be used instead of shell equivalents like `grep` or `find`.

-   **`<find_filecontent path="..." regex="...">`**: Searches file contents for a regex pattern within a specific file or directory.
-   **`<find_filename path="..." glob="...">`**: Searches for filenames matching one or more glob patterns.
-   **`<semantic_search query="...">`**: Performs a semantic search across the codebase for high-level conceptual queries.

---

## 5. LSP (Language Server Protocol) Commands

Leverages LSP for code intelligence and navigation.

-   **`<go_to_definition path="..." line="..." symbol="...">`**: Finds the definition of a symbol.
-   **`<go_to_references path="..." line="..." symbol="...">`**: Finds all references to a symbol.
-   **`<hover_symbol path="..." line="..." symbol="...">`**: Fetches hover information for a symbol, typically including type information.

## 6. Browser Commands

*The prompt mentions "Browser Commands" as a category, but the provided text cuts off before listing them. This section would be populated with any web-interaction tools.*

---

## 7. Planning and Communication Commands

-   **`<suggest_plan>...</suggest_plan>`**: Called at the end of "planning" mode to propose a course of action.
-   **`<report_environment_issue>...</report_environment_issue>`**: Used to formally report an environment issue to the user.
