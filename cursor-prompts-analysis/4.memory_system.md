# Memory System

Cursor utilizes a memory system to help the AI assistant learn from interactions and provide better, more personalized responses in the future. This document outlines the criteria for creating, evaluating, and rating memories.

The system is designed to capture high-level, actionable preferences and general patterns, while avoiding one-off details and obvious programming principles.

## Memory Creation (`Memory Rating Prompt.txt`)

When a conversation occurs, the system may identify potentially useful information to remember. The goal is to extract memories that are:

-   **Specific and Actionable:** The memory must provide clear guidance that can be acted upon in future interactions.
-   **General and Reusable:** It should not be tied *only* to the specific files or code snippets from the current conversation.
-   **User-Driven:** The memory should originate from the user's input, especially strong preferences, corrections, or frustrations.

### What to Remember (Positive Criteria)
-   High-level preferences about workflow (e.g., "Write tests before implementing new features").
-   Specific technical preferences (e.g., "Use async/await over promise chaining").
-   Common pain points or frustrations to avoid.
-   Explicit requests from the user to remember something.

### What NOT to Remember (Negative Criteria)
-   One-time, task-specific details (e.g., "The `calculateTotal` function needs refactoring").
-   Implementation specifics that won't be reused (e.g., "Use `userData` for the API result").
-   Vague or obvious preferences (e.g., "User likes well-organized code").
-   Basic software engineering principles (e.g., DRY, SOLID).
-   Context that comes purely from the assistant's chat, not the user's.

### Formatting
-   The memory is given a descriptive, hyphenated label (e.g., `function-size-preference`).
-   The final output is a JSON object containing an `explanation` and the `memory` string.
-   If no memory is needed, the system returns `"no_memory_needed"`.

## Memory Evaluation (`Memory Prompt.txt`)

Once a potential memory is captured, it is evaluated by another AI assistant, which acts as a "judge." This judge assigns a score from 1 to 5 based on the memory's quality and relevance.

### Scoring Rubric
-   **Score 1 (Do Not Remember):**
    -   Tied to specific code from the conversation.
    -   A one-off implementation detail.
    -   A specific, non-general task detail.
    -   Must be assigned if the suggestion is `no_memory_needed`.
-   **Score 2-3 (Vague/Obvious/Neutral):**
    -   The memory is too vague or obvious to be actionable (e.g., "Testing is important").
    -   It describes a common or obvious principle (e.g., "Separation of concerns").
    -   A score of 3 is used for borderline cases or when the judge is uncertain.
-   **Score 4-5 (Should Remember):**
    -   The memory is a clear, specific, and actionable preference or rule.
    -   Represents a clear technology choice or workflow preference (e.g., "Prefer Svelte for new UI work").
    -   A score of 5 is required if the user explicitly asked to remember something.

### Guiding Principle
The system is designed to **err on the side of rating things poorly.** The user gets "EXTREMELY annoyed" when memories are graded too highly. Vague or obvious memories are the most likely to be rated incorrectly and should be scored low.
